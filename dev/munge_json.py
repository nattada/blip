# python munge_json.py /path/to/console/output 'data-type'
# this script expects two command-line arguments in order:
# 1) the name of the raw console output (copied and pasted from blip's console) text file
# 2) the datatype you'd like to extract (e.g., 'basal-rate-segment')
# at present, you can only extract one datatype at a time
